Description: Tools for estimating and assessing goodness-of-fit in the class of
    the multivariate Box-Cox symmetric distributions generated by a normal scale mixture
    copula (referred to as the BCNSM distributions). The class constitutes a general and
    flexible framework for modeling multivariate positive continuous data. Each margin can
    follow a different Box-Cox symmetric distribution, providing flexibility to accommodate
    data with varying marginal distributions, including different types of skewness and
    tail-heaviness. Furthermore, the dependence within the BCNSM distributions is entirely 
    described by a normal scale mixture copula, regardless of the marginal specifications. 
    Thus, the class can accommodate any monotonous association between the variables.
